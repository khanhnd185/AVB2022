# Fine-tuning Wav2vec for Vocal-burst Emotion Recognition

This is the source code of our proposed method in [Fine-tuning Wav2vec for Vocal-burst Emotion Recognition]()

We (SclabCNU Team) paticipated in [The 2022 ACII Affective Vocal Burst Workshop & Challenge](https://www.competitions.hume.ai/avb2022).

We used pre-train Wav2Vec provided by [Pytorch] (https://pytorch.org/audio/0.10.0/pipelines.html)
